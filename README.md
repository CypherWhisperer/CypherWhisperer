## 🚀 What I'm Building

I'm on a journey to merge **artistry with code**, crafting web applications that don't just function—they captivate. As someone who appreciates both the visual beauty of frontend design and the elegant complexity of backend architecture, I believe great software is where creativity meets security.

### 🎨 **Frontend Artistry**
- **React.js** ecosystem exploration
- **3D web experiences** with Three.js and WebGL
- **SVG animations** and interactive graphics
- Creating visually stunning, user-centric interfaces

### ⚡ **Backend Engineering**
- Designing robust, scalable infrastructure
- Building secure APIs and microservices
- Database architecture and optimization

### 🔐 **Security-First Development**
Obsessed with privacy, anonymity, and digital security. I don't just write code—I write *secure* code. Every project is an opportunity to explore how deep the security rabbit hole goes.

## 🛠️ **Current Learning Path**

```cpp
// Currently mastering DSA with C++
while (learning) {
    practice(algorithms);
    solve(problems);
    optimize(solutions);
}
```

**Languages in Focus:**
- **C++** - Data Structures & Algorithms foundation
- **Rust** - Systems programming and memory safety
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Modern web development
- **Python** - Automation and scripting
- **Lua** - Configuration and scripting

### 🐧 **Linux & CLI Enthusiast**
Two years ago, I took the leap—wiped my disk and went full Linux. No regrets. I live in the terminal and love building CLI tools that make workflows feel like magic to others.
